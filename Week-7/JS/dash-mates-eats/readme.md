# JS (Again)

One of the main uses of JS as a front end web tech is in creating dynamic web pages.

**?** Are responsive webpages inherently dynamic? Is responsive web desgin analogous to dynamic web design?

**A** Not exactly. A good webpage is dynamic and responsive. _Responsive_ web design is related to how your web app renders in different viewports, ie your app still looks good on mobile or on the desktop. _Dynamic_ web design is related to how your application would behave given certain events and user inputs.

**Note:** If frontend web tech were parts of the body, html would be the skeleton (defines structure of your page as well as content), css would be the skin (defines the look and feel of your app), and js would be the muscle (defines the behavior of your application).

One of the cool things you can do in JS is basically shape shift (ie manipulate the HTML DOM in some way). With the way JS can shift the structure of your page, some people thought, hey, what if, instead of waiting for the next HTML page to be served to us, why don't we just restructure parts of our web app and just wait for data from API? This is the general idea behind SPAs (Single Page Applications).
